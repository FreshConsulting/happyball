# HappyBall - A Fresh Future Innovator Code Workshop

This code was presented during the Fresh Future Innovator's coding workshop in 2019.

It is a simple Python example that was used to demonstrate using an algorithm to solve a problem. It also had a fun ball that bounced around the screen.

Feel free to take this code and make it your own and have fun along the way!
